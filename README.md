# Global-CO2-Emissions-Dashboard

**Overview**

This project analyzes global CO2 emissions using data from the World Development Indicators. The goal is to explore trends, identify major contributors, and assess the relationship between emissions and economic factors. The dataset includes emissions and economic indicators from 2014 to 2023 for 21 major countries.


**Project Objectives**

This project aims to analyze global CO2 emissions by identifying the top 10 emitting countries, examining regional contributions, and assessing the economic impact of carbon intensity. The findings provide insights into emission patterns and policy recommendations to mitigate climate impact.

**Data Source & Indicators**

Source: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators# (Generated using 10 Series)
Indicators Used: Total greenhouse gas emissions excluding LULUCF (Mt CO2e), Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions excluding LULUCF per capita (t CO2e/capita),  Carbon intensity of GDP (kg CO2e per 2021 PPP $ of GDP)
Data Range: 2014 - 2023
Countries Included: 21 major contributors to global emissions

**Learning Experience**

This project involved data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization using Python. Libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn were used for analysis. The study helped deepen my understanding of global emission patterns and the role of economic factors in carbon output. Automated insights were generated to summarize key findings and policy recommendations.

**Acknowledgments**

This project was made possible by publicly available data from the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators. I appreciate the resources and guidance available through online communities and open-source platforms.
